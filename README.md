# Image-Compression
#Single Value Decomposition SVD

In This notebook I will use Single Value Decomposition in *Image compression*

* Converting RGB image to Gray by 3 ways
* Compress the gray image by Single Value Decomposition
* Try to compress it with diffrent k values
* Calculat Compression Ratio
* Compare the quality of compressed image with original one by Mean Squared Error, Cosine Similarity, Structural Similarity and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
